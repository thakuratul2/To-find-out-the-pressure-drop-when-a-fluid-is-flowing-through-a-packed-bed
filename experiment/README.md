## Aim:
To calculate the pressure drop per unit length of bed. To plot modified friction factor vs. modified Reynolds no. on a log-log plot

## Theory:
Packed bed provides a large surface area of contact between two fluids and is thus extensively used in distillation extraction absorption etc. As the fluid passes through the bed. it does so through the voids present in the bed the voids from continuous channels through out the bed .the flow may be laminar through some channels and turbulent in other channels.

Fluids are forced to flow through stationary beds of particulate or porous solids in a wide range of particle situations including moisture assimilation by soils, adsorption, ion exchange, and many of the examples noted in the introductory section.

Modified Reynoldsâ€™s number Rem is defined as:

Modified friction factor is defined as:

Where Dp is the equivalent diameter , <img src="./images/pic-3.png" /> are pressure drop per unit length bed porosity, density of water and velocity of water in bed.
